## ✅ Example MVP Flow

1. User says: "Hey JARVIS, what's the weather today?"
2. Speech-to-text (Whisper)
3. Send text to GPT + weather plugin or API
4. Fetch data & generate reply
5. Speak reply (TTS)
6. Log to memory: interaction, intent, topic

---

## ✍️ Next Steps

1. Start with MVP: Voice-based assistant with memory and GPT-4
2. Add UI and facial interface
3. Expand to API integrations
4. Add cross-platform support
5. Secure and offline capabilities
